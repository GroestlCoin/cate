Vortex v1.0.0 - Andromeda
-------
+ Complete UI redesign {
	- Color adjustments to match Yokomoko's EasyMiner.
	- Main UI has been refreshed and redesigned.
	- Better design language, and more consistent throughout the program.
	- Added an actual program logo :D
}
+ Added ability to save 7 GRS addresses as contacts in the new contacts section
+ Added tx fee option when sending GRS (using sats/byte) {
	- Instead of using GroestlcoinJ's default fee, you can now set your own custom fee. :) Minimum fee is 10 sats/byte. (Using anything less wouldn't be propagated)
}
+ Name change from GRSX to Vortex Wallet {
	- GRSX felt weird. It felt like a weird coin-fork name. Vortex sounds cooler. :)
}
+ Versioning system changed from numbers (vX.X.X) to numbers + version title (for example: vX.X.X "Deep Space")
+ Internal code changes and optimizations
+ Added an autogenerated file in /data/ called Vortex.properties to change between Mainnet and Testnet for developers.
